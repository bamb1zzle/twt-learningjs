<!-- The 5 Primitive Data TYPES
string = anything inside quotation marks
number = any type of number, not inside quotation marks
boolean = true/false, capital T and capital F are different.
undefined = haven't defined something yet, it becomes undefined when we don't give it a value
null = set valu, we're not storing anything yet. it acts as a placeholder.

The sequence of running these methods matter as it runs line by line.
Once you've defined a variable, to change it you only need to state it.
