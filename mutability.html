mutability - changeable/unchangeable
primitive data types and objects. 

var x = 5
var z = []
var s = z

when i change anything in s it changes z and vice versa because these reference the same object 
doesnt store the value of the array but stores the array as one object in total.

primitive data types = dont change. 
we are just referencing values.

inside our function = num = x - creates a copy but doesnt change the underlying value of this primitive data type variable. 

Reference and Object Data types (Copying vs Reference Points)

Passing in entire array. And push 5 onto array and print out the value of the array. Passed the actual object. Not a copy of it. 
When we pass the array it changes the object. 

Design funcions that dont need to return certain values but just modify the input you've sent them.

When we create a variable thats equal to the object. We don't store the value of the object but the location of the object instead.
