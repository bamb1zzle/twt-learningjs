<!-- 
Sets are another data type in javascript.
Unordered collection of unique elements.
Collection -> multiple elements.
Unordered -> We don't keep track of the elements. (But we do)
Unique -> no elements can exist more than once.

We cannot index elements directly. We can only see if elements exist, add or delete elements.
Can add the same element multiple times but can only exist there once.
When we use sets we only care if elements exist. We don't care about frequency.
Sets have 01 look up time = instant search time.

When to use sets vs array?
If array is too big and we just need to see an element. 
Maintains constant look up time. 
set.has()
set.size
set.delete() - when you delete somethign that doesn't exist in the set you get a false return statement.
set.values() - returns to us all of the values inside of the set in the order they were inserted.
